Installation
---------------

1. Shutdown your game server. 
2. Unzip the NMLScenario_X.zip file.
3. Locate your RE2Beta scenario directory.  Typically D:\empyrion\Content\Scenarios\RE2Beta
4. Copy contents of Playfields directory into D:\empyrion\Content\Scenarios\RE2Beta\Playfields
5. Copy contents of Sectors directory into D:\empyrion\Content\Scenarios\RE2Beta\Sectors
6. Unclear if D:\empyrion\Cache\RE2Beta needs to be deleted.  Let's assume no for now.
6. Restart your game server
7. If this is a fresh install of the NML Scenario then clients likely don't need to delete their cache.  If its an up date to the NML Scenario then cache clearing may be necessary.


Manual local installation: Building a fresh RE2 custom scenerio
1. Navigate to Steam folder where Empyrion is installed and find the workshop folder for RE2
	xxx\Steamlibrary\steamapps\workshop\content\383120\3143225812
2. Copy that entire folder into your Empyrion scenerios folder.
	xxx\Steamlibrary\steamapps\common\Empyrion - Galactic Survival\Content\Scenerios\
3. Rename the 3143225812 to something like RE2Custom or an easy identifier
4. Either extract SDGPlugin.zip into it's own folder and copy all folder contents into your new RE2 scenerio or paste it directly into your new RE2 scenerio and extracthere.
5. If done right you should be prompted to overwrite files and folders, please do so.
6. Start a new game, choose scenerio and select your RE2 custom scenerio
